building_castra_exercitus: "Material Armory"
building_castra_exercitus_desc: "A facility Armoring Units for war with a slight material output"
building_librarium: "Librarium"
building_librarium_desc: "During the terrible wars of the Age of Strife, untold quantities of knowledge were lost, and preserving that which remains has become a holy task shared by the Administratum and the Adeptus Mechanicus. In many of the larger cities of the more advanced Imperial worlds, an imposing Librarium building will house thousands of books and records, and make them available to those Imperial servants whose rank entitles them to access."
building_manufactorium: "Manufactorium"
building_manufactorium_desc: "Although much technology was lost during the fifteen centuries of the Age of Strife, the Imperium is by no means technically backward. Industrial complexes across the galaxy produce billions of items, from clothing to plasma bombs. All of these installations are closely controlled by the Administratum and the Adeptus Mechanicus, and it is not uncommon for the workers in a factory to be completely unaware of the end-product of their labours. The occupation or destruction of the manufactorium or industrial complex can deny precious resources to the enemy."
building_auditorium: "Auditorium"
building_auditorium_desc: "Most Imperial cities have at least one auditorium, where the populace assemble at great rallies organised by the Administratum and the Inquisition. A visiting dignitary, such as an Inquisitor or a Space Marine commander, will often be requested to lead such a rally. It is common practise to use the main auditorium - if it still stands - to announce the 'liberation' of a city by one side or the other."
building_factorum: "Factorum"
building_factorum_desc: "The factory manufacturing consumer goods for the Imperium citizens."
building_mausoleum: "Mausoleum"
building_mausoleum_desc: "For the vast bulk of the citizens of the Imperium, death is not the end of their service to the Emperor.

More prominent members of society may receive the honour of entombment in an Imperial mausoleum, where the masses may read of their deeds and be inspired by their example. With its halls of entombed heroes, a Mausoleum can become the focus of a fanatical defence, and its destruction can deal a severe blow to the defenders' morale."
building_planetary_turret_1: "Defence Turret"
building_planetary_turret_1_desc: "Turrets are large static weapon emplacements used by the Imperium of Mankind to protect important structures and other strategic facilities from enemy attack.

building_administratum_desc: "The complex organisation of the Adeptus Administratum is responsible for the administration of the whole of the Imperium; it manage over a million inhabited worlds. Planetary government buildings, record offices, taxation centres and many more are controlled by the Administratum. They are usually distinguished by the sign of the Imperial Aquila over the main door. Many bloody assaults and valiant defences have taken place in and around urban and planetary government buildings; they are natural command points, and the fall of the Administratum normally indicates the fall of the city. This building is often an attacker's primary target."
building_censorium: "Censorium"
building_censorium_desc: "Countless clerks and officials labour on a million worlds for the Administratum, most of them confined to dark offices in grim, towering administrative blocks. These buildings house vast quantities of information on their worlds; population, economy, levels of production and taxation, resources, industrial and agricultural quotas - the whole of the world is recorded, filed, indexed and updated by an army of bureaucrats. The valuable data in a Censorium can make it a prime target."
building_arbitratorum: "Arbitratorum"
building_arbitratorum_desc: "Feared by bosses of Hive City black market, law enforcement structure houses cells, armoury and bureaucracy of one of the largest Imperial organisations. The rooftop has a landing pad for skimmers and small aircrafts, which can easily transform into a firing platform. With fortifications barring those of planetary defense force, Law Enforcmement headquarters can withstand attacks not only of gangs but even of an invading army."
building_chapel: "Chapel"
building_chapel_desc: "In narrow alleyways, scattered between Cathedrals and nobility houses, are Hive City Chapels - beacons of spiritual light. Constructed by first missionaries, who visited the planet centuries ago, its automechanisms work endlessly, emmiting light and chanting uploaded prayers. Each of them is a sanctuary, as well as a bunker. In times of war, people may hide here, safe from enemies - and their thoughts."
building_cathedral: "Cathedral"
building_cathedral_desc: "Jewel of the imperial architecture, Hive City Cathedral rises above toxic fumes and crowded streets. Built for several centuries, its once glooming towers have seen how the city changed and risen around it.

building_confession_machine: "Confession Machine"
building_confession_machine_desc: "With billions of sinners, the Imperial Preachers called upon creating machines capable of quickly determining the guilt and punishment of those not obeying the Emperor's credo. Raised next to the walkways of cities skyscrapers, automatic Confession Machines are programmed to detect every dark thought, scanning Imperial citizen for mutation and corruption within. If the victim inside is found guilty, the adamantium gate closes and furnace fire begins to rage - few seconds later ashes are scattered by vents on top, and gate opens welcoming next law abiding citizen..."
building_confessorum: "Confessorum"
building_confessorum_desc: "When population of hive city is undoubtfully tainted by powers of Chaos, the Ecclesiarch calls to create Hive Confessorums - places of mandatory admission, where civilians are fetched in by law enforcers. A generator-like structure, prepared by Mech-priests to fit several Confession machines, automatically checks the level of guilt and mutation in citizens. When the level is too high, adamantium gate closes and engines begins to roar as flames encompass screaming victim. In some deserted cities, these places of execution still possess bones of the heretics inside, forever caged inside the machine which decided about their guilt."
building_execution_site: "Execution Site"
building_execution_site_desc: "Sometimes Imperium must make an example of someone to keep masses in order - by fear of punishment. This guillotines are widely spread among squares and in front of cathedrals. Once the execution is announced through the speakers around the city, citizens gather to hear the crimes of convict. More than once rebellions started in such places, with judges being decapitated by those, who were previously threatened."
building_generatorum: "Generatorum"
building_generatorum_desc: "Each passing day, citizens gather in the early hours of the morning to work in Cog-Father facilities, fuelling the imperial economy. The Generatorums are most common of those factories, with reactors strong enough to provide power for skyscrapers standing next to them. If the hive world is attacked, these facilities provide much needed energy to fuel tanks or even titans."
building_cellarion: "Cellarion"
building_cellarion_desc: "No world is an island within the Imperium; each gains something from the rest of the galaxy, and each must pay its way. The worlds of the Imperium provide foodstuffs, machinery, minerals and many other things according to their resources. Few Imperial cities are without vast warehouse complexes where these goods are collected ready for shipment to other areas and worlds, and where incoming goods are placed ready for distribution."
building_penance_station: "Penance Station"
building_penance_station_desc: "People who are not receiveing capital punishment for things they did, are chained and closed behind iron bars, sentenced to starve and live their last days in shame. Exhibited to publics eye, they are a subject of mocking by pedestrians. Too often, their lives meet premature end when a passer-by decides to seek justice on his own."
building_propaganda_post: "Propaganda Post"
building_propaganda_post_desc: "On cities squares and crossings are Propaganda Posts, covered in posters and announcements for citizens. From its loud, creaky speakers you can hear a low voice of Preachers, and Mech-priests announcing working hours, times of assembly and, if the time is dire, curfews. Each night law enforcement must check if no rebelious contents are pasted on them."
building_residence: "Residence"
building_residence_desc: "Generatorum managers, high-level bureaucrats, chiefs of security – they form an upper class, which can afford to live in more luxurious apartments, above toxic fumes of Hive City."
building_ventilation_shaft: "Ventilation Shaft"
building_ventilation_shaft_desc: "Billowing clouds of toxic fumes come not only from factories and Generatorums - throughout the city, the excess heat and smoke is ventilated by specialistic vent shafts, preventing lower living masses from dying of intoxication. However, due to being used for literaly thousands of years, their filter capabilities have worn out long time ago, without the knowledge of population on lower levels..."
building_street_clock: "Street Clock"
building_street_clock_desc: "Street clocks are remnants of past ages - more likely seen in older Hive Cities. The clock's face is made of expensive crystals, with gold and silver metal used for indicators and numbers. Most of them carry inside atomic technology, known only for Chrono-priests of Mechanicum..."
building_triumphal_arch: "Triumphal Arch"
building_triumphal_arch_desc: "With every victory, the Imperial army returns to planet's capital, celebrating and showing the spoils of war. The culminating point in their march is where Imperial Triumphal Arch is erected. On its walls are inscribed names of Crusade's heroes - ones who sacrificed their life in the service of Imperium. Wide enough to accomodate Legionaries tanks, each passing column of soldiers writes their own history - each of them dreaming of commemorating their deeds in this dark galaxy. "
building_saint_statue: "Saint Statue"
building_saint_statue_desc: "Hive City Saint Statue watches the streets beneath, frozen in gesture of blessing as commemorated by artist centuries, if not millennia ago."

building_water_towers_desc: "A relic of the past, water containers on top of habitats are still used in grimdark future, popular among lower-class citizens. A disease which enters one of such water tanks is spreads in a flash between hundreds of families which inhabit the unfortunate apartments. Due to living outside of careful eyes of the Arbitratorum Judges, these diseases kill thousands before someone from top of the spires notices what's going down below."
building_fountain: "Fountain"
building_fountain_desc: "A common sight for wealthy citizens, fountains can be found in parks and city squares.
